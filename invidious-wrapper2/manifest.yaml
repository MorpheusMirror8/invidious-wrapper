    Invidious is an open-source alternative to YouTube. It aims to provide a faster, more privacy-respecting, and ad-free way to browse and watch videos from the site. It also includes features like a dark mode and the ability to play videos in the background. Invidious can be run on a user's own server or accessed through instances run by others.
